#- Dnsmasq is a lightweight and versatile DNS forwarder and DHCP server that simplifies network configuration by providing DNS resolution and IP address assignment for devices on a local network. It acts as a local DNS server, allowing devices to easily resolve domain names and efficiently manage IP addresses within a network.

- in odroid we have a default dns service systemd resolve so first we want to disable it


sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved

> we need to delete all content in /etc/resolve.conf because by default dnsmasq read this file
{.is-warning}

- now install dnsmasq on odroid

```
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

```
- Change /etc/dnsmasq.conf to configure dnsmasq to cache entries for at least 24 hours
``` the cachesize here.
cache-size=10000

#if you want to disable negative caching, uncomment this.
no-negcache

#Normally responses which come from /etc/hosts and the DHCP lease
 file have Time-To-Live set as zero, which conventionally means
#do not cache further. If you are happy to trade lower load on the
 server for potentially stale date, you can set a time-to-live (in
#seconds) here.
local-ttl=86400
```

-To test dig to any domain name in first time it is 3msec in second and third it should be 0 msec (cached)
